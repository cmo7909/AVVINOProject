# AVVINOProject
Mock website for the restaurant AVVINO

Goal: Practice use Angular and other software practices to develop a mock website for the
resturant AVVION (I work here). I aim to have full functionallity while making an aesthetically
pleasing website. Once some sort of product is made I would like to present it to my boss and take any feedback to better tailor the website to the "client".
